## Intuition to scale equating

Previous chapter introduces the sources affecting the comparability of different poverty indices and presents the concept and empirical implementation of measurement invariance. In poverty research, households are ranked according to some indicators of (low) material and social deprivation using survey or census data. The indicators in question have a structure (unidimensional or multidimensional, See chapter \@ref(Chapter-1)) for the general population. One problem is that such a measurement model might not be adequate for a different populations (such as countries) or for a different years. We saw in previous chapter that in statistical terms this means that the measurement model is not equivalent across groups. We now know that, once a MI assessment has been conducted, poverty can be compared on the factor using the aligment method. This, however, might not be fully satisfactory for policy makers as the values of a standarized latent variable make little practical sense. Furthermore, it is unclear how to use these values to set a poverty line. 

Another critical problem is that MI is adequate when scales have the same items and it does not solve the problem of working with scales that have different items or that have been upgraded in accordance with the living standards. Ideally, once measurement invariance is assessed researches would like to put everything into a meaninful metric and being able to compare measures that might have suffered from changes in its contents. Moreover, one question in poverty research is about how the severity of poverty is affected by changes in living standards and how this can be tractable using the available data. Thus poverty measures need to be equated or equivalised in some way so that we can make meaninful comparisons across groups or time.

Scale equating is the answer from measurement theory to the problem of working with scales that are not necessarily equivalent across countries, time points, etc. Educational testing is perhaps the field at the forefront of scale equating. Admisions to universities often depend on the score of a test. But what if this test favours some students? and  What if different versions of the tests are implemented? This poses a challenege for the adminsions' office for two students might have different scores but just because the tests had different difficulties, i.e. one was easier than other. 

How does this problem translate to poverty measurement? There are two good examples to see this happening to our scales. According to @Townsend1979 poverty is relative across time and space. The *space* to identify the dimensions and indicators of poverty in the early 20th Century would look very different from the *space* of things and activities necessary to live with dignity in the 21st Century. For example, overcrowding and access to electricity were very good indicators of poverty in London but these days is no longer the case. That means that the two measure will have different deprivation indicators. So what does it mean that someone in the early 20th century had a deprivation score equal to 6 relative to someone that has a score equal to 3 today? Is it possible to compare how severely deprived they are? And how this might or might not impact the prevalence rate? 

This is a very crude example but it helps to illustrate some of the challenges when comparing poverty overtime. In poverty research one common beleif is that using the same indicators helps us to make comparisons across groups. Leaving aside the data collection and sampling issues associated with MI, we could think carefully about this assumptions. Imagine that we use indicators of the early 20th to measure poverty today. Then we have two people with the same deprivation pattern- they lack electricity, cook with charcoal, and live in an overcrowded house. So they have the same deprivation scores. In the early 20th century it would not be very difficult to find such conditions in a small random sample. However, these days this situation would denote acute material deprivation. But these two people will have the same deprivation score, so without equating they would be equally deprived. How sensible is this conclusion? Well, not very. 

Scale equating aims at adjusting the differences in severity between tests and groups. The process of equating, given the response patterns, will notice that it is *more difficult* (as in Item Response Theory modelling) today being deprived of the items in question than 100 years ago. So, based on difficulty, the contemporary scale will be adjusted in terms of the early 20th Century's scale. If the equating process is succesful, it should make sense and a score equal 3 today would mean something more severe in terms of a score equal 3 100 years ago, i.e. it will be higher. The inflation of today's score will be the result of equating and it will tell us a lot of useful information to adjust our conclusions about poverty and severity of deprivation. 

The second example, focuse on the practical use of equating. Statistical offices tend to update their indices overtime or we tend to have countries with two different measures but with some common indicators. So they drop so indicators and include some new indicators. This fuels the frustration of policymakers and academics because comparability is lost. One way to tackle this problem is scale equating. Figure \@(fig:changeEQ) displays a common situation in which the indicators have changed from measure A (Poverty) to measure B (Poverty B). There are seven items that appear in both measures and two items that were dropped and other two that were included. 

```{r changeEQ, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='This figure shows the case in which there is a modification in the contents of a measure. In red there are the common items between the two measures', fig.pos='H', fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("Diagram_EQ_1.png")
```

One crucial aspect of the example above is that if we have to tests with a common subset of items, then we can assess not only the effect of the updating of the scale but also we could link both measures and make them comparable across time points. We will see that for scale equating to work we need to identify as many **anchors** as we can, i.e. items that respect measurement invariance across tests. In this case we have seven potential candidates. In the following we introduce formally the concepts and methods to conduct scale equating. We will, of course, discuss some limiations of this approach as it might be sensible in all situations or desirable.
